I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu). I received my bachelor's degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), where I was a member of [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home).

My research interests lie in the area of theoretical computer science, with a focus on optimization and machine learning theory. I am also interested in compiler optimization and online algorithms.

Please check out my [CV](https://oscardhc.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
